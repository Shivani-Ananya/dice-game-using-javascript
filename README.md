# dice-game-using-javascript
hello all, as a part of my learning journey in web-development, I am glad to say i have successfully completed javascript too. to test my ability, I have built a dice game.
this game allows the user to change the dice number when the page is refreshed.
if the die one has greater number it says, "Player 1 wins"
if the die two has greater number it says, "Player 2 wins"
if both die are same, then it says, "TIE"
